# 🌱 QBTW | A Terrible QBittorrent Seed-tracking Widget <a href="https://github.com/grigsbyanthony/QBSW"><img src="GitHubAssets/logo_nonsize-transformed.png" align="right" height="100" /></a>

A pet project in the form of an unobtrusive, toolbar/widget-based torrenting tracker for QBittorrent users. An excellent excuse to learn Swift, more than anything. For use in pulling large archived files from a storage server.
